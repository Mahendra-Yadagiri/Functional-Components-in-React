# Functional-Components-in-React
This project demonstrates the power of functional components in React by building a modular and reusable UI. It showcases how functional components can handle different data types, props, and event handling to create a clean, scalable structure
Functional Components: Built entirely with React functional components to ensure simplicity and reusability.

Props Usage: Passed data as props to demonstrate reusability across multiple UI elements.

Event Handling: Implemented event-driven features using onChange, onFocus, and onBlur for interactive inputs.

Reusable Design: Components like cards and lists are written once and reused for multiple datasets (e.g., laptops, cricketers).
